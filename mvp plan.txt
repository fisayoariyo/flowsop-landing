                             FlowSOP
A simple tool that turns screen recordings into step-by-step how-to guides.

💡 Imagine This:
You hit record, do a task on your screen (like setting up a new user in your CRM), then hit stop.

FlowSOP takes the video, and gives you a clean document like:

css

1. Go to your CRM dashboard [screenshot]
2. Click “Add New User” [screenshot]
3. Enter user details and click Save [screenshot]

All of that happens automatically.

✅ Why This Product Works
Companies need to train new people fast

Nobody enjoys writing boring SOP documents

Most current tools are either too expensive or manual

AI now makes this easier and faster than ever before
